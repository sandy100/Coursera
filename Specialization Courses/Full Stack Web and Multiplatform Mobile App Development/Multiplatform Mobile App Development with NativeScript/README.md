## Multiplatform Mobile App Development with NativeScript(Coursera)
https://www.coursera.org/learn/nativescript/home

The framework uses Angular, TypeScript or modern JavaScript to get truly native UI and performance while sharing skills and code with the web. Learnt about UI development with NativeScript UI and layout support and access the native mobile platform's capabilities from Javascript. 
At the end of this project I was able to:
*	Build mobile applications targeting multiple platforms with a single codebase
*	Leverage my Angular, TypeScript and Javascript skills
*	Use various features of the Ionic framework to build truly cross-platform mobile applications
